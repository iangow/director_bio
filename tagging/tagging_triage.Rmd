There are various categories of issues. 

Q: Are there cases where we already have tagged bios, but no assigned RA in the "remaining filings" sheet?
```{r, include=FALSE}

library(RPostgreSQL)

pg <- dbConnect(PostgreSQL())

missing_bios <- dbGetQuery(pg,"
    SELECT 
    FROM director_bio.remaining_filings
    INNER JOIN director_bio.bio_data
    USING (file_name)
    WHERE assigned_ra IS NULL")

rs <- dbDisconnect(pg)


```

A: There are `r dim(missing_bios)[1]` such cases.
